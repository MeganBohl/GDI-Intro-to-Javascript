How does JavaScript work?
You visit a website with JavaScript code on it.
Your browser (e.g., Chrome) reads the code line-by-line.
The browser runs each line of code as it reads it.
Based on these instructions, the browser performs calculations and changes the HTML and CSS on the page.
If the browser finds code it doesn't understand, it stops running and creates an error message.

Statements
Each instruction in JS is a "statement", like:
console.log('Hello World!');
console.log('I am glad to meet you');
console.log('I am fuzzy');

Comments
You can leave comments in your codeâ€”notes that people can read but computers will ignore.
/*
I can make long comments
with multiple lines here
*/

console.log('Hello World!'); // Or make short comments here

Getting results onto your screen
Open a popup box.
alert('Hello World!');
Display a message in your console.
console.log('Hello World!');
Add something to the page.
document.write('Hello World!');

Variables
Just like 'x' in algebra, a variable is a named container for a value that can change.

Declaring a Variable
To declare (create) a variable, just type the word var and the variable name.
var numberOfKittens;
It is a good idea to give your variable a starting value. This is called initializing the variable.
var numberOfKittens = 5;

Variable Values
When you first create a variable, it does not have a value (it is undefined).
You can set a value for a variable.
Variables can hold different types of data.
The value of a variable can change over time.

Data Types
string string of characters
var userName = 'Jane Lane';
number integer or floating point
var myAge = 30;
boolean true or false
var catsAreBest = true;
undefined value that hasn't been defined
var favoriteThings;
null an explicitly empty value
var goodPickupLines = null;

Arithmetic Operators
Once you have numbers, you can do math with them!
var numberOfKittens = 5;
var numberOfPuppies = 4;
var numberOfAnimals = numberOfKittens + numberOfPuppies;

Arithmetic Operators
Example	Name	Result
-a	Negation	Opposite of a.
a + b	Addition	Sum of a and b.
a - b	Subtraction	Difference of a and b.
a * b	Multiplication	Product of a and b.
a / b	Division	Quotient of a and b.
a % b	Modulus	Remainder of a divided by b.

Strings
Variables can be strings (groups of characters). You put your string in single or double quotes.
var kittensName = 'Fluffy';
If you want to use a quote in your string, you'll need to escape it with a backslash.
console.log('I\'d like to use an apostrophe');

String Operators
You can put strings together with a +, the concatenation operator.
var kittensName = 'Fluffy ';
var fullName = kittensName + 'McDougle';
console.log(fullName); // Outputs 'Fluffy McDougle'
